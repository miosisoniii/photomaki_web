### What the hell is a photomaki?

The name "photomaki" comes from the sushi roll, the *futomaki*. It's defined as a fatty roll, typically characterized by a fatty fish surrounded by a variety of vegetables. I **love** sushi so it was only natural to merge my aversion towards sushi and photography via this brand's name.
