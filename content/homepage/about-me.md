Oh, hello. Didn't see you there. This isn't a very good photo of me, is it? This is just a random black woman with incredible curls. I'll **definitely** be replacing this photo with one of me very soon. 

### About Me
My name is Artemio Sison III. You can call me *Mio*, for short (pronounced "Mee-oh"). By day I am an R&D scientist focusing on vaccines and immuno-oncology. By night I am a budding photographer and owner of **photomaki**.ÃŸ
