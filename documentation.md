# photomaki_web
My Photography portfolio.

## Getting Started 
To build my website, I am using the Hugo web framework. I am building this primarily in R, using [this](https://seanlee0622.medium.com/create-and-publish-a-website-with-r-and-hugo-2b7d1ff236f5) tutorial.

I chose to use the [scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/) theme from Jan Raasch's GitHub [page](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-scroll). 

I have also been using [Johannes Wienke](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/)'s page as inspiration/template for my work as well.


# Other Potential Avenues for Portfolio

### About the Website

#### Image Display

Here are a few website photo display tools that I used to make this page:
- [Justified](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/) Gallery for the collage of photos that will show an entire collection but also show the picture fullscreen if desired.
- [lightGallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com) is a Java tool that allows the user to view the fullsize image, along with descriptions!

#### Photo Stories
- [Exposure](https://www.johanneswienke.de/posts/2020/05/a-new-portfolio/). I can display a series of photos without much text initially (but will have captions) to tell a story. Very good for individual posts or trips that I may go on.
- or even [Behance](https://www.johanneswienke.de/posts/2020/05/a-new-portfolio/)

# photomaki

### What the hell is a photomaki?
The name "photomaki" comes from the sushi roll, the *futomaki*. It's defined as a fatty roll, typically characterized by a fatty fish surrounded by a variety of vegetables. I **love** sushi so it was only natural to merge my aversion towards sushi and photography via this brand's name.


## About Me
My name is Artemio Sison III. You can call me *Mio*, for short (pronounced "Mee-oh"). By day I am an R&D scientist focusing on vaccines and immuno-oncology. By night I am a budding photographer and owner of **photomaki**. I am looking
