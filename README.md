My Photography portfolio.

## Getting Started 
To build my website, I am using the Hugo web framework. I am building this primarily in R, using [this](https://seanlee0622.medium.com/create-and-publish-a-website-with-r-and-hugo-2b7d1ff236f5) tutorial.

I chose to use the [scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/) theme from Jan Raasch's GitHub [page](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-scroll).
